# Hello-World
My first repository on GITHub, it's always good to learn something new :)
I've been working in IT since 1987, although for a few years that's been in management positions rather than developing code.
I've also spent a few years implementing and coaching TPS / Lean, so I'm very interested in Agile practices.
Outside of work, I've been a taiji player for almost as long as I've been working in IT :)
